- add value checking to the createathleteinterface screen (date / name)
- add cache so that screens remember any data that was entered before entering subscreen
- only track maximum lifts? or should all lifts be tracked? data contstraints?
- create an inputcontroller class
    - create a way to handle common forms of input (input then assignment, etc.)
- generalize the interfacetemplate displayinterface method to cover a broader range of uses
    - there should be a RequiredInformation: List[str] list
    - there should be a DisplayOptions: Dict[str, str] dict
    - there should be an InterfaceDialogue: List[str] list
    - a for loop should go through all of the required informatio and take the input and assign it
- create a RDMS for tracking all lifts
    - the RDMS should have a controller
    - quick and efficient access via calls to the controller
    - indexing of the top 50(?) lifts of each lift type for quicker lookup; should this be an index cluster?
- qol settings
    - qol setting where you can make it so screens run through each character instead of printing the entire screen at once
